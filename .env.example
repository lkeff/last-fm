AFK_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=10
AFK_WARNING_MINUTES=2

# Security Logging Configuration
# Controls how security events are logged and what information is included
SECURITY_LOG_LEVEL=info
SECURE_LOGGING=true
CLEAR_LOGS_ON_EXIT=false

# Content Security and Link Validation
# Protects against malicious external links and content injection
ENABLE_LINK_VALIDATION=true
STRICT_CSP=true
REQUIRE_LINK_CONFIRMATION=true

# Anti-Scam and URL Protection
# Prevents access to suspicious domains and malicious URLs

# =============================================================================
# SECURITY SETTINGS DOCUMENTATION
# =============================================================================

# AFK_ENABLED: Enable/disable the AFK guard system
# - true: Automatically lock the application after inactivity
# - false: Disable AFK protection (not recommended for production)
# Performance impact: Minimal (only event listeners)

# AFK_TIMEOUT_MINUTES: Minutes of inactivity before locking the session
# - Recommended: 5-15 minutes for high security, 15-30 for convenience
# - Minimum: 1 minute, Maximum: 60 minutes
# Consider your usage patterns and security requirements

# AFK_WARNING_MINUTES: Minutes before timeout to show warning
# - Should be less than AFK_TIMEOUT_MINUTES
# - Recommended: 1-3 minutes to give users time to respond
# Helps prevent unexpected session locks during active use

# SECURITY_LOG_LEVEL: Verbosity of security-related logging
# - error: Only log security errors and critical issues
# - warn: Log warnings and errors (recommended for production)
# - info: Log general security events (recommended for monitoring)
# - debug: Verbose logging for development and troubleshooting

# SECURE_LOGGING: Enable automatic scrubbing of sensitive data from logs
# - true: Remove API keys, tokens, and personal data from logs (recommended)
# - false: Log raw data (only for development, never in production)
# WARNING: Disabling may expose sensitive information in log files

# CLEAR_LOGS_ON_EXIT: Automatically clear logs when application closes
# - true: Enhanced privacy, no persistent logs
# - false: Keep logs for debugging and audit trails (recommended)
# Consider compliance requirements and debugging needs

# ENABLE_LINK_VALIDATION: Validate external URLs before opening
# - true: Check URLs against allowlist and scan for threats (recommended)
# - false: Open all external links without validation (not recommended)
# Protects against phishing and malicious websites

# STRICT_CSP: Enable strict Content Security Policy
# - true: Maximum protection against XSS and injection attacks (recommended)
# - false: Relaxed CSP for compatibility (only if experiencing issues)
# May affect compatibility with some external content

# REQUIRE_LINK_CONFIRMATION: Show confirmation dialog for external links
# - true: User must confirm before opening external links (recommended)
# - false: Open external links immediately after validation
# Provides additional protection against accidental clicks

# ENABLE_URL_SCANNING: Scan URLs for known threats and suspicious patterns
# - true: Advanced protection against malicious URLs (recommended)
# - false: Basic validation only
# Includes detection of URL shorteners, suspicious TLDs, and phishing patterns

# BLOCK_SUSPICIOUS_DOMAINS: Block access to known suspicious domains
# - true: Prevent access to domains flagged as potentially malicious
# - false: Allow access to all domains (not recommended)
# Regularly updated list of suspicious domains and patterns

# ENCRYPT_LOCAL_DATA: Encrypt sensitive data stored locally
# - true: Encrypt samples database and cached data (recommended)
# - false: Store data in plain text (only for development)
# Uses AES-256-GCM encryption with machine-specific keys

# =============================================================================
# DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
# =============================================================================

# DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:
# - Set AFK_TIMEOUT_MINUTES to a higher value (30-60) for convenience
# - Enable debug logging (SECURITY_LOG_LEVEL=debug)
# - Consider disabling REQUIRE_LINK_CONFIRMATION for faster testing
# - ENCRYPT_LOCAL_DATA can be false for easier debugging

# PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT:
# - Use shorter AFK timeout (5-15 minutes) for better security
# - Set SECURITY_LOG_LEVEL to 'warn' or 'info'
# - Enable all security features (all true values recommended)
# - Always enable ENCRYPT_LOCAL_DATA in production
# - Regularly review and update security settings

# HIGH SECURITY ENVIRONMENT:
# - Set AFK_TIMEOUT_MINUTES to 5 or less
# - Enable CLEAR_LOGS_ON_EXIT for maximum privacy
# - Use SECURITY_LOG_LEVEL=error to minimize log data
# - Consider additional monitoring and audit trails

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file: cp .env.example .env
# 2. Edit the .env file with your actual API keys
# 3. Configure security settings based on your requirements
# 4. Never commit the .env file to version control
# 5. Restart the application after making changes
# 6. Review security settings regularly and update as needed
# 7. Test security features in development before deploying
